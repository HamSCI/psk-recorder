"""Process-local ring buffer for FT4/FT8 sample accumulation.

Keyed by **absolute RTP sample offset** (an unwrapped 64-bit sample count
measured from the SlotClock anchor), NOT by floating-point UTC.  Each batch
is tagged with the offset of its first sample, derived from the GPS-true RTP
timestamp radiod stamps on the packet (see ChannelSink.on_samples).  Slot
extraction then asks for an exact ``[start_off, start_off+n)`` window, so the
audio handed to the decoder always corresponds to the RTP grid point its WAV
is labelled with — immune to the delivered-sample-count drift that the old
UTC-projection ring suffered (real RF, wrong label -> 0 decodes).

Simple deque of (samples, start_offset) tuples behind a threading.Lock.
No SysV IPC, no cross-process consumers.  Sized to hold ~3 cadences.
