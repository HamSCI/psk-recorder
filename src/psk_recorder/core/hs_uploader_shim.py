"""hs-uploader-driven PSK Reporter spot uploader.

Uses the hs-uploader library's ``Pipeline`` + ``Uploader`` orchestrator
and the ``PskReporterTcp`` transport (which owns the TCP socket
end-to-end — no third-party library involvement).

This is the sole PSK Reporter upload path; ``recorder.PskRecorder.
_start_uploaders`` constructs it unconditionally.

Source selection:

* ``SqliteSource`` — reads sigmond's local SQLite sink
  (``/var/lib/sigmond/sink.db`` by default, or ``SIGMOND_SQLITE_PATH``),
  the queue ``sigmond.hamsci_sink.Writer`` fills.  ``extra_where``
  filters scope the queue to this daemon's ``radiod_id`` so multi-
  instance is safe by construction.
* No SQLite sink → fall back to ``FileTreeSource`` reading per-slot
  ``.spots.txt`` files the ``SlotWorker`` writes when
  ``PSK_USE_HS_UPLOADER=1`` and no sink is present.  Files are deleted
  on PSKReporter ack (delete_on_ack retention).

Other notes:

* ``PskReporterTcp`` owns the socket — no ``pskreporter`` Python
  library dependency, no PSKREPORTER_INTERVAL/NO_DEDUP env-var
  knobs.  Cadence is the pump interval here.
* Watermark + retry state persist to ``/var/lib/hs-uploader/
  watermarks.db`` (sqlite); restarts pick up where they left off
  rather than re-deriving from "now".
