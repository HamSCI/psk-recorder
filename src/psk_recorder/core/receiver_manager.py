"""ReceiverManager: per-radiod channels, streams, and tailers.

One ReceiverManager per source (= one radiod control plane).  A
PskRecorder process holds N of these — one for single-radiod
deployments (legacy ``--radiod-id`` mode) or several for multi-source
deployments where the same process drives a local radiod plus remote
radiods over the LAN (mirrors wspr-recorder's multi-source pattern).

The class owns everything radiod-specific:

  * ``RadiodControl`` connection
  * ``ChannelSink`` instances (one per (mode, freq))
  * ``MultiStream`` instances (grouped by multicast destination)
  * Lifetime-keepalive entries (handed to the process-global keep-alive
    thread in :mod:`recorder` so we don't spawn one thread per source)
  * Per-mode log file descriptors and ``ChTailer`` instances
  * Spool dir under ``<spool_root>/<radiod_id>``

PskRecorder remains the process-global orchestrator: chrony settle gate,
uploader fanout, stats aggregation, main loop, and watchdog.
